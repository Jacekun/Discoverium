## Finding App Configurations
If you can't find the configuration for an app you want, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/cygnusx-1-org/Discoverium/issues).

### Vetting
I haven't created a policy or process yet.

## Fork
Discoverium is a fork of [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium). [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) is great, but it is missing one feature. That feature is a search function for application discovery, like a repository or store. As far as can be told the lack of the feature is very intentional.

## Installation

## Limitations
- For some sources, data is gathered using Web scraping and can easily break due to changes in website design. In such cases, more reliable methods may be unavailable.
